# NRC_33-LW_Grism_Stability
The goal of this activity is to assess the stability on the grism time series mode using astrophysical targets that show signals similar to a transiting exoplanet using both long-wave (LW) grism observations as well as short-wave (SW) simultaneous photometry with a weak lens.
